# Find Skills

Your gateway to the open agent skills ecosystem. Search, discover, and install specialized capabilities for any domain.

## What This Skill Does

The Find Skills skill connects you to the Skills CLI package manager, which indexes hundreds of community-contributed skills for design, testing, deployment, and more. Instead of building everything from scratch, discover existing skills that extend ClaudeKit's capabilities.

Think of it as npm for AI agent skills — search by keyword, preview what each skill does, and install with a single command.

## When to Activate

This skill activates when you:
- Ask "how do I do X" where X might have an existing skill
- Say "find a skill for X" or "is there a skill for X"
- Ask "can you do X" for specialized capabilities
- Express interest in extending agent capabilities
- Want to search for tools, templates, or workflows
- Mention wishing for help with specific domains

## Core Capabilities

- Search skills interactively or by keyword
- Install skills from GitHub or other sources
- Check for skill updates
- Update all installed skills
- Browse the skills catalog at https://skills.sh/

## Usage

Activate by asking about available skills or capabilities.

## Example Prompts

- "How do I make my React app faster?"
- "Find a skill for PR reviews"
- "Is there a skill for creating changelogs?"
- "Can you help with accessibility testing?"
- "What skills are available for Next.js development?"

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Search for skills
npx skills find [query]

# Install a skill
npx skills add <package>

# Check for updates
npx skills check

# Update all skills
npx skills update
```

## Common Skill Categories

| Category | Example Queries |
|----------|----------------|
| Web Development | react, nextjs, typescript, css, tailwind |
| Testing | testing, jest, playwright, e2e |
| DevOps | deploy, docker, kubernetes, ci-cd |
| Documentation | docs, readme, changelog, api-docs |
| Code Quality | review, lint, refactor, best-practices |
| Design | ui, ux, design-system, accessibility |
| Productivity | workflow, automation, git |

## How It Works

1. You ask about a capability
2. ClaudeKit searches the skills ecosystem
3. Presents relevant skills with install commands
4. Offers to install for you with `-g -y` flags
5. Skill becomes available immediately

## When No Skills Are Found

If no relevant skills exist, ClaudeKit will:
1. Acknowledge no existing skill was found
2. Offer to help directly using general capabilities
3. Suggest creating your own skill with `npx skills init`
